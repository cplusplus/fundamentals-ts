<!-- This element creates a button that creates a link to a standalone HTML
     version of the current page.

     This will only work with the ShadowDOM polyfill, but we'll eventually
     implement support for native ShadowDOM.

     If the 'source' attribute is present, a "Sources at ..." comment
     will appear at the top of the result document.
