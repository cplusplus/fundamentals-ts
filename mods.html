      Implementations that conform to this document shall

    <p>References to clauses within ISO/IEC 14882:2020 are written as "C++20 &#xa7;3.2".</p>

    <h1>Exception Requirements</h1>
    <p>The following modifications to the Library introduction (<cxx-ref in="cxx" to="library"></cxx-ref>)
      allow the destructor of <code>scope_success</code> (<cxx-ref to="scopeguard"></cxx-ref>) to throw exceptions.</p>
    <p>The requirements of <cxx-ref in="cxx" to="res.on.functions"></cxx-ref>
      shall apply with the following modification:
      An applicable <i>Throws:</i> paragraph
      (in addition to any applicable <i>Required behavior:</i> paragraph)
      can allow a replacement function or handler function or destructor operation
      to exit via an exception.
    </p>
    <p>The requirements of <cxx-ref in="cxx" to="res.on.exception.handling"></cxx-ref>
      shall apply with the following modifications:
      Destructor operations defined in the C++ standard library are permitted to throw exceptions
      if this is explicitly specified.
      Only those destructors in the C++ standard library that do not have an exception specification
      shall behave as if they had a non-throwing exception specification.
